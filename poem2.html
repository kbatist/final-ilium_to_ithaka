                "Odysseus, sail home—"
        "The sea keeps his secrets,
        salt-stained and endless,
        yet Odysseus leans toward Ithaca
        as though memory itself were a compass.
        Every wave whispers of Penelope,
        her loom weaving patience into years,
        her silence louder than the sirens.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Return to me," the winds seem to call,
        He is a man caught in the history of man—
        a tale of wars and wanderings,
        of choices carved into stone,
        yet soft with yearning.
        <br>
        <br>
        The gods write destinies in thunder,
        but he writes his own in longing,
        each exile a stanza,
        each return a prayer.
        He remembers the song of home,
        fragile as breath,
        and wonders if love can outlast
        the myths that bind him.
        What is a hero,
        if not a man who aches to belong,
        who carries the weight of stories
        but dreams only of her hands"
